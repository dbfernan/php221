        <h1 id="main">Give Blood, Save Lives</h1>
        <p>
            A blood donation from a single person can save up to three lives, making them a vital part of our healthcare system. Blood cannot be manufactured and its only source is from donors.
        </p>
        <h2 id="main">Serving Patients in Critical Need</h2>
        <p>
            Blood donations are critical in providing hospitals and medical facilities with the lifesaving blood supplies they need for patients requiring transfusions. Theyâ€™re essential for patients experiencing various medical conditions, such as blood-related diseases, procedures, or injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples Include:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accident Victims</li>
                <li>Burn Victims</li>
                <li>Cancer Patients</li>
                <li>Surgery Patients</li>
                <li>Chronic Blood Disorder Patients</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Blood donations can also reduce the risk of iron overload, lower the risk of heart disease, and treat sickle cell disease.
        </p>
        <h2 id="main">Boosting the National Blood Supply</h2>
        <p>
            Access to blood transfusions is critical to healthcare because it directly impacts patient survival and recovery in various medical situations. Securing blood donations ensures that hospitals have enough blood supply throughout each procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
            As one of the only non-profit organizations in the United States that focuses on providing blood services through voluntary donations, the American Red Cross is vital to maintaining the blood supply for our target population. In Healthy People 2030, this is critical to achieving the "Increasing Access to Healthcare Services" objective.
        </p>
